# JS-30-Part-1

This repository contains my completed solutions for the first 10 challenges of the [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/) course by Wes Bos. Each project focuses on core JavaScript concepts, helping strengthen my vanilla JS skills through practical, hands-on mini-projects.

09. Dev Tools Domination - https://dev-tools-domination.vercel.app/

10. Hold Shift and Check Checkboxes - https://hold-shift-and-check-checkboxes-gamma.vercel.app/

Each of these challenges helped me understand various aspects of JavaScript like event handling, DOM manipulation, working with arrays, canvas drawing, and much more. These are deployed using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for quick access and sharing.

Stay tuned for Part 2 as I continue to build and explore the remaining projects in this exciting series!
